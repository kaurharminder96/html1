<h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">Newspapers are published in many languages. They may be dailies, published every day, or weeklies, published each week. Printed on newsprint, newspapers contain news and views on varied topics. The news published may be on politics, economy, society, business, science, sports and entertainment from around the world. Newspaper publishers hire journalists as reporters and correspondents to write for them. Editors work with a team at newspaper offices to edit stories before they are published in the papers.

News that is published must be factual and error-free; only then will people subscribe to a newspaper. Newspapers may be delivered at our doorsteps or picked up at shops or from hawkers on the street. The general public depends on newspapers for authentic published news
